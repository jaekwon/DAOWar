## Make blockchains fun again

This site aims be a repository for arguments for both ETH and ETC.  Add to this
discussion by [submitting an issue](http://github.com/jaekwon/daowar/issues), or

**DAO war**: A state of crypto-economic conflict between two distributed
autonomous organizations.  _Ethereum and EthereumClassic are in a
state of DAO war._

If the exploit of TheDAO and the following hard-fork of Ethereum into ETH and
ETC has taugth us anything, it's that we need nuanced social contracts

The levels of engagement of DAOWar:

* The need for prior Social Contract
  - ETH and ETC have different social contracts
  - Law

* Levels of engagement

- Level 1: Copying distributions allowed, PR allowed.
- Level 2: Exploitable contracts.
- Level 3: Protocol attacks, consensus attacks.
- Level 4: Cryptographic cracking exploits.
- Level 5: Malware, anything goes, the ultimate gladiatorial arena

* Need for Level 2.

"I would like to see ETC get to the point where no one can cry foul over attacks
done there, on exploitable contracts or possibly even the consensus protocol.
That would give it a reason for existence, and different use-case, from ETH.
code == law, after all"

These levels of engagement as social contract, when combined with responsible
disclaimers for everyone involved, can allow whitehat hackers to ethically
participate in real-world cryptoeconomic experiments and exploits, for our
collective understanding and benefit.

Also, it'll be fun.

* Difference between "no hard-forks vs no rollbacks"

* Freedom of speech?

* Dangers
- Cross chain replays
- Consensus attacks
 - low mining hash power can get attacked by borrowing hash power from the main
   chain. smart contracts can make this dicier.
- Maximalism
- Propaganda
 - A big factor of ETC support may come from those who wish to harm ETH.
  - Lack of real community?

* Learnings
- need for chainID
- Threat or opportunity?
 - Chandler Guo
 - Miners largely follow opportunity
 - Market liquidity dominates hashpower, so miner voting doesn't make much
   sense.

Why would any rational holder of ETC not seek to trade it immediately for ETH?
swing traders could keep upside momentum.

Run applications they wouldn't run on mainnet for fear of censorship. 

* The value of ETH vs ETC
- I'd rather let the ETH community roll back massive theft, than risk creating
  buggy code on ETC.
- The integrity of the prior social contract of immutability.

//--------------------------------------

"The Ethereum hard-fork undid one of the only useful things about Ethereum for
me... The entire point of Ethereum is that nobody else can stop my programs, and
I can't stop anyone else's programs"

"It's a huge setback for those of us who value core principles such as
immutability, neutrality, transparency, etc..."

"It could be a step forward if people internalize the right lessons"

"It annoys the crap out of me that people believe blockchains are political
systems where users can vote"
-- no time to evaluate, no time to discuss issues well, votes can be gamed and
manipualted easily"

"It's easy to do whatever you want when you have a cult of personality
reinforcing your decisions"

"The ETH/ETC incident drastically changed my perspective on the whole thing.
Before I was thinking as long as we can effectively make it impossible for
miners to collude it would become practically impossible to change the rules.
But it's clear that miners just follow the markets... we need to design for this
scenario"

"So it's not forks we need to avoid, but rather contentious HFs"

"We've had altcoins for a while now... but chain forks are far more problematic
because of both the status of the tokens that get split and whetehr the two
networks cooperate to avoid cross-chain attacks"

"If the game is about "consensus by social media" lets just accept that and stop
pretending we've built mathematically safe money.  Having said that, I don't
think many competent engineers would find "consensus by social media" to be a
very promising base layer for a global digital asset.

Point is if it really is humans all the way down, what we're talking about is a
political system... not a mathematically safe money.  Perhaps mathematically
safe money is impossible.

>> Look at all we've got!  Auditable, tarnsparent, permissionless access and

Dunno - unfortunately, I think I trust more in the fed at this point :(

>> There is no 100% fault tolerance either.  That's provable.  But it's
>> *tolerant*.  And is it antifragile?

At least the fed has people who understand finance and monetary policy.

>> Oh?  I think we'll have to see where NIRP goes.

I prefer the fed to reddit for these kinds of decisions, to be honest

>> It's not just reddit.  The market is making ETC work despit reddit.

Not only is voting on a proof-of-work system utterly moronic, even assuming it
made sense to vote on a PoW system, it's like voting in an election where you
can just disregard the results.

"I wonder if legal action will come of exchanges that didn't credit ETC.
Arguably, it's like a stock split and it's the responsibility of the custodian
to protect all the value"

>> Hmm, need more social prior contract.

"I am surprised by the lack of coordination to attack ETC.  Any TheDAO token
holder might be incentived to subsidize the attack of ETC, but it hasn't been
happening.  Maybe we just don't have the tools yet to coordinate such a briber
attack"

>> 51% attacks are risky for the attacker, and it requires a cartel unless
>> someone controlls all the hashpower.

Or a good smart contract with a set of oracles with some reputation.

>> Unless someone has more than half the hashpower, miners have an incentive to
>> let other
